# Multiple-output-motor-temp
 Business Objective: Predict Motor temperature based on other attributes available  The dataset comprises several sensor data collected from a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) deployed on a test bench. The PMSM represents a german OEM's prototype model. Test bench measurements were collected by the LEA department at Paderborn University. This dataset is mildly anonymized. All recordings are sampled at 2 Hz. The dataset consists of multiple measurement sessions, which can be distinguished from each other by column "profile_id". A measurement session can be between one and six hours long. The motor is excited by hand-designed driving cycles denoting a reference motor speed and a reference torque. Currents in d/q-coordinates (columns "i_d" and i_q") and voltages in d/q-coordinates (columns "u_d" and "u_q") are a result of a standard control strategy trying to follow the reference speed and torque. Columns "motor_speed" and "torque" are the resulting quantities achieved by that strategy, derived from set currents and voltages. Most driving cycles denote random walks in the speed-torque-plane in order to imitate real world driving cycles to a more accurate degree than constant excitations and ramp-ups and -downs would.
